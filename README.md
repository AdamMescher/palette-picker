# Palette Picker

A user should be able to come to the site, generate a color palette, and save it for their own future projects.

## Set up the development environment

### Clone or download the repository and open the terminal in the newly created `palette-picker` directory

### `$ npm install` - installs all necessary packages locally

### `$ npm start` - runs the command `node sever.js` to start the application at http://localhost:3000/
